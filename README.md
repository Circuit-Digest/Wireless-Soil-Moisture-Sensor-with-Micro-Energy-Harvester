In today's rapidly evolving world, technological advancements continue to reshape industries, with agriculture and gardening being no exception. Imagine having the ability to effortlessly monitor soil moisture levels in your garden or farm remotely. In this project we are aiming find a solution for that. This innovative solution utilizes a capacitive soil moisture sensor, along with long range LoRa communication without the hassle of manual recharging or battery replacements. 
This project utilizes ADP5091, an ultralow power energy harvester PMU with MPPT and charge management from Analog Devices for charging the internal battery from solar energy. We can either use a LiPo battery or a super capacitor for storing the energy. For the controller, we have used the popular ATMega328 MCU, which is widely used in Arduino boards. The moisture sensing is done using a capacitive sensor built around a TLC555C chip. RFM69W module is used for communication. The sensor and LoRa module will only be turned on when necessary. This will help us to reduce energy usage during deep sleep period.
